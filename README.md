# Streaming Audio from a web browser to Unity application
* Please note that you need to use Unity Render Streaming Asset in the Unity application for this to work.
* Repo consists of a folder 'WebApp'. This folder is the web server to stream audio from a web browser.
* There is also a C# file which contains the code to use the audio stream and save it to a file on the device.
* Note that this is a sample file, use the code in this file in your Unity application file.

## Running the WebApp
* In this web server, click on the audio streaming sample and select your mic from the drop down.
* When the Unity application is running with the code to receive the audio stream, click the play button.
* Now you will be able to live stream audio.
